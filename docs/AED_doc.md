## 3. 📁 Data Format and Standardization

To ensure consistency and interoperability across all datasets, the following standardization protocols have been implemented:

### 📂 File Structure

All cleaned and harmonized electricity demand datasets are stored in the `Data-files/` directory.  
Each file represents data from a specific country and is available in both `.csv` and `.parquet` formats.

This centralized file structure facilitates easy access, comparison, and processing of demand data across countries.

### 🧾 Data Format

- Electricity demand values are expressed in **megawatts (MW)**
- Supported output formats: **CSV** and **Parquet**
